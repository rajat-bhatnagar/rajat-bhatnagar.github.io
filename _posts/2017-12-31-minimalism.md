Alright, another idea and pattern which stemmed off from Netflix documentary on [Minimalism](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460).

As I sit at my desk pondering over the innumerable thoughts in my head, I am absolutely convinced that minimalism is the only way I can de-clutter the unnecessary clutter in my life. I have always been a collector, a collector of things. My clutter comprises of electronic books, gadgets, past life baggage of thoughts and an insatiable thirst to get more.

Why do I do this?

To be honest,I do not know. Until this moment i never realized  that  getting more will not change what I currently have or will have an effect/impact on making a difference in my life.

Things are just resources and resources never make a difference, **Actions** do.

I have put this blog in place to keep a track and check my progress on decluttering the things I have or associated myself with

> - **Softwares**
> - **Gadgets**
> -  **Clothes**
> -  **Shoes**
> -  **Credit Cards**
> -  **Bank Accounts**
> -  **Social Accounts**
