I wasted 3 days of work and exercise because of extreme pain around my lumbar region.

The Cause
---------

Friday's workout at CrossFit was gruesome. I threw a lot of heavy rogue slam balls over my shoulder and lower back was well worked out and exhausted.

On Saturday at YMCA... I again did a workout the lower muscles of the Hip abductors by performing multiple repetitions s without keeping a tab on the number of sets I was doing.

This aggressive workout approach ***backfired*** and on Sunday early morning (**7th Jan 2018, 4 AM**) , I had a shooting pain around the lumbar region and after countless rounds of applying an ointment, gentle massage with oil, heated water bag fomentation and occasional painkiller, I was finally able to recover/ sit properly (**9th Jan 14.05 PM**).

Lesson learned
--------------

 - Never ever treat your body like a machine
 - Do not do aggressive workouts without proper rest
 - Workout, Rest, Recover, Regain and Repeat.
