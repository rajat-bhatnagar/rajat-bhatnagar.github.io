Today s workout was much more rigorous than imagined. My body was still recovering and right wrist was bit choppy , but all the pains were forgotten as soon as the  workouts started.

Workout Regime :
-------------
#### **Dumbbell, Kettle-bell and Rod**
1. Lifted 25 pound dumbbell vertically with right hand.
2. Lifted 25 pound dumbbell vertically with left hand.
3. Lifted 15 pound dumbbell with right && left hand together.
4. Tried snatch movement with the rod, However we switched to kettle bells as i could not take a step backwards after the snatch
5. Snatch movement with kettle bell. Remember that while holding the kettle bell the thumb should touch your chest and while doing a snatch movement make a straight line through the middle of your head.

#### **CARDIO 15 Minutes Non Stop**
1. Swing movement with Kettle bell - Right hand
2. Swing movement with Kettle bell - Left hand
3. Pull yourself completely up using gymnastic wood rings
4. Take 2 complete rounds of Crossfit gym
5. Repeat 1 to 4

As per my coach , my diet needs to be modified , I am eating a lot of Complete Carbohydrate diet and my morning breakfast of 2 apple juice sucks as that is direct fructose to my body. My favourite drink of carmel macchiato coffee also needs to wander off in dust . SIGH.... Also my in between snacks of dry fruits(Almonds + Cashew + Walnuts + Pistachios) needs to be regulated as that is a lot of calories . All of these inputs were a big eye opener and i realized why my weight had suddenly shot up.
