**Location**: [Southdale YMCA](https://www.ymcamn.org/locations/southdale_ymca)
**Duration**: 50 Minutes
**Time**: 1:00 PM CST

I had my wellness consultation with Kim at the YMCA today. We sat by the glass window overlooking the pool and after our discussion about the kind of exercises i am doing,  she said that i had a good workout plan in place.

Once our meeting was over , She handed me a note which was the general suggested workout plan. ( Refer the image at the end of the blog)

One good thing which came out of our discussion was that i should probably try the WARMER Swimming Pool and try doing my stretches there instead of the lap pool.
