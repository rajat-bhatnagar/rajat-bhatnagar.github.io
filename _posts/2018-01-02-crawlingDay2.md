**Weather**: Cold

Day two of crawling was done really late, I got caught up with critical office work during the day and neck pain from the previous day of swimming goof up got from bad to worse. As soon as I arrived home from the office , I just jumped on the bed for rest and immediately went to sleep.

I got up around 11 PM and realized it was late but workout had to be done. Crawling was finalized immediately and by the time I winded off the workout regime it was 1 PM. This is not something which I should be proud of but satisfaction after winding this up was ***priceless***.

-------------
**Workout Time**: 45 Minutes, No Break
**Music**: Silence

#### **Crawling**
1. 3 Rounds Bedroom to StudyRoom

#### **Crunches on Ottoman**
