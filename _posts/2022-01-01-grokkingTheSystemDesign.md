    -  Non Functional Requirements
    - Extended requirements (Analytics, Accessibility by other services)
-  Back of the Envelope Estimation Capacity
-  Estimations and Constraints

    - After finalizing the system requirements, define the System APIs. This should expliciylt stte what is required from the system
- Defining Data Model
    -  Defining the database schema in the early stages of the interview would help to understand the data flow among various components and later would guide towards data partiotioning
- High Level Design
- Detailed Design
- Identifying and Resolving Bottlenecks
