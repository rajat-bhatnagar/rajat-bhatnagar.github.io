On New Year's Eve of 2017, I decided to try something new and immediately  Crawling came to my mind. After figuring out the logistics I decided to crawl from the bedroom to study room and vice versa. Our entire apartment is heavily carpeted, so scratching skin while crawling was the least of my concern.

What seemed like an innocuous task was way more difficult and this coupled with leg extension pulls and hip glute raises made the workout interesting.
