**Weather**: Cold

Every time I do a CrossFit workout with my trainer Jason, it is an amazing realization what my body is capable of.

Workout Regime :
-------------

#### **Ski Erg**

1. 3 Sets of Side Movements : Reach Out / Pull the SkiErg to your side - [SkiErgTechnique Video](http://www.concept2.com/skierg/training/technique-video)
3. 3 Sets of SkiErg Movements with Alternating Arms - [SkiErg AlternatingArmTechnique Video](http://www.concept2.com/skierg/training/technique-video)

#### **Rogue slam ball**
1. Lifted 20-pound rogue Slamball to either side by shoulders : 3 sets with 20 repetitions.

After this, i was asked to throw a 75-pound sandbag over my head, Tried a couple of time s but did not succeed. This is a ***FUTURE*** goal

#### **Barbell Rod**
1. Clean and Jerk on the barbell rod : 3 sets with 10 repetitions [Technique](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjpkcnK5MTYAhULKiYKHSg6AM8QtwIIKDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8miqQQJEsO0&usg=AOvVaw0vs2lrHgCiLLE_ndyX7FDy).

Pay extra focus on your wrist and elbow (elbows should not be too broad) and the subtle movement when you bring the barbell down

#### **Cardio with Ski Erg and Rogue Slam Ball**
1. Row 250 meters on Ski Erg, Rush to the box where 12 Rogue slam balls of varying weights(30, 25,20 and 15 pounds are kept)
2. Lift rogue slam ball and throw it over the side of the shoulder over your back
3. Repeat until 4 sets of the above are completed and do not stop in between

#### **Shoulder and arm Stretch using Resistance bands**
Jason made me do this to stretch my sore muscles, I am not sure of how to put this in words. Putting this here as a future reference placeholder.
