I have always been intrigued by **Crossfit**, and this started from the time I watched [Fittest on Earth: A Decade of Fitness](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6491170/) on Netflix. Even before I relocated to MN from CT earlier this month, i was hell bent on joining CrossFit and experimenting what it could do for me.

I finalized on [Crossfit UFFDA](https://crossfituffda.com/) and after my workout today I thought of penning the subtle details on my blog so that I and maybe others could reference this later and evaluate whether or not CrossFit workouts are good for someone with limited mobility.

I went to sleep yesterday around 10 PM-ish (alarm ready) and got up on time, My appointment with the coach Jason was at 6:30 AM and I arrived on time. It was bitterly cold at morning -11 F and the only saving grace was that this workout location was just a 10 min drive.

Workout Regime :
-------------
#### **WHITE ROD**
1. Started with the white rod and did rotations for both the shoulders, Hold the Rod wide, Lift one side of the rod, move it back and rotate.
2. Use the extension staps, Put the rod inside the strap and facing the opposite direction pull the rod down from up to down, With each movement keep on reducing the distance between the wide grip.

#### **ROPE**
 1. Clasp the rope while sitting on your chair and pull yourself up ( Right, Left)
 2. Transferred to the floor and tried lifting myself up by pulling myself up (Right, Left and vice versa)

#### **CRUNCHES**

 1. Lie on the Floor > Get your shoulders off the ground in crunch
    position > Take one arm move it back and come back, Do a controlled
    movement and do not hurry
 2. Lie on the Floor > Get your shoulders
    off the ground  in crunch position > Take both arms move it back and
    come back, Do a controlled movement and do not hurry

#### **PUSHUPS**
 1.  Put a foam roller underneath your legs move a little forward and do a full pushup

#### **CARDIO**
 1.  Remain Opposite to Assault Air bike and do the tro and fro movement fast, I was hitting 40 RPM

Overall I was able to do well and after the workout had a discussion with the coach. I need to work on my flexibility and strengthen my core.
